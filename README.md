# Salon Appointment Scheduler

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum for the "Relational Database" certification.The Salon Appointment Scheduler is a Bash script designed to facilitate booking appointments for various services offered by the salon. It interacts seamlessly with a PostgreSQL database named "salon" to manage customer details, service information, and appointments effectively.

# Project Description:

The Salon Appointment Scheduler project aims to develop a Bash script for managing appointments at a salon. It allows customers to book appointments for various salon services and assists salon staff in organizing appointments efficiently. Inspired by the need for streamlined appointment booking processes, this project focuses on creating a user-friendly script that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve customer information, service details, and appointments.

Key Aspects:

- Database Creation: Create a PostgreSQL database named "salon" to store information about customers, services, and appointments.

- Database Schema Design: Design a database schema tailored to salon appointment data, defining tables with appropriate columns to accurately represent customers, services, and appointments.

- Data Population: Populate the database with initial data, including information about available services and any existing customer records.

- Appointment Booking: Implement functionality for customers to book appointments by selecting a service, providing their phone number, name (if not already a customer), and desired appointment time.

- Customer Management: Manage customer information by checking for existing records based on phone numbers and adding new customer records if necessary.

- User Interaction: Develop a user-friendly Bash script interface that guides users through the appointment booking process and prompts for necessary information.

- Error Handling: Implement proper error handling to handle invalid inputs and ensure a smooth user experience.
